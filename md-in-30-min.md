##### What is Markdown

Markdown is a simplified markup language that is used for formatting text. It
gives you a way to format text so that it can be converted to HTML. It was
originally described as a text-to-HTML formatting tool.

##### Why & Where to use it

Markdown is a lot easier to learn, read and use than HTML. It is one of the 
most popular ways for formatting blogposts, documentation, and note-taking, as
well as Python notebooks (Jupyter notebooks as Markdown documents). You can
create tables and flowcharts in MD, as well as write entire research papers and
books in this MD syntax.

There are different flavors of Markdown, there are minor differences between
them which came about because of flawed specificatoins at the beginning of the
development of Markdown. People came up with ways to fill up the gaps on their
own. For example, there is GitHub Flavored Markdown, or GFM, which offers a few
additional features to Markdown on their platform.

Some of the most popular apps for note-taking with MD are:
- Bear App
- Standard Notes
- Joplin
- Obisidian  

For blogs, a platform called Ghost may come in handy, that also gives you an 
admin interface to write your blogs in MD. 

Some forums also utilize MD, such as the freeCodeCamp forum and many other
development forums. It's also popular in Jamstack.
