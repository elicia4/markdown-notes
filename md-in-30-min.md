### What is Markdown
---

Markdown is a simplified markup language that is used for formatting text. It
gives you a way to format text so that it can be converted to HTML. It was
originally described as a text-to-HTML formatting tool.

### Why & Where to use it
---

Markdown is a lot easier to learn, read and use than HTML. It is one of the 
most popular ways for formatting blogposts, documentation, and note-taking, as
well as Python notebooks (Jupyter notebooks as Markdown documents). You can
create tables and flowcharts in MD, as well as write entire research papers and
books in this MD syntax.

There are different flavors of Markdown, there are minor differences between
them which came about because of flawed specificatoins at the beginning of the
development of Markdown. People came up with ways to fill up the gaps on their
own. For example, there is GitHub Flavored Markdown, or GFM, which offers a few
additional features to Markdown on their platform.

Some of the most popular apps for note-taking with MD are:
- Bear App
- Standard Notes
- Joplin
- Obsidian  

For blogs, a platform called Ghost may come in handy, that also gives you an 
admin interface to write your blogs in MD. 

Some forums also utilize MD, such as the freeCodeCamp forum and many other
development forums. It's also popular in Jamstack. 

### Basics of Syntax
---

*This will not cover what is already covered in the [quick
guide](md-in-1-min.md).*

A good way to create a table of contents:

``**Table of Contents:**``

It will be displayed like so:

>**Table of Contents:**

You can use `~~` to strike through text:

>`~~striken~~` == ~~striken~~

This is useful for lists.  

You can also have italic text in the middle of bold
text, for example `**There is *italic* text here**`
renders as:  

>**There is *italic* text here**

You can nest items in lists:

1. 123
    1. 123
    1. 456
1. 456  

The fact that you don't have to identify each item in a list with a correct
index is useful for cases when you need to quickly reorder a list, since you
don't have to change the indices manually for them to be in a correct order.
Try it out:

1. I am first 
1. I want to be third
1. I want to be second  

You can indicate which language of you code you use inside of you code blocks
to make your highlighting better:

``` py
import rand-lib
class Random:
    number = value
    values = (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

To add horizontal lines, use `---`:

---

A thin horizontal line is also added under the H1 header on many platforms.

You can create multiline quotes, you can also use HTML with MD, for example:

```
>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Et malesuada
fames ac turpis egestas maecenas.
>
> -- <cite>Bob Ross</cite>
```

Renders as:

>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Et malesuada
fames ac turpis egestas maecenas.
>
> -- <cite>Bob Ross</cite>

You can quote HTML tags (the problem is with the 'less that sign', or `<`) by
using either backticks (`` `<` ``) or `&lt;`, which will render as `<`.

For unordered lists, `-` is more widely supported than `*`.

A lot of platform automatically create ids for all headers in your whole
document based off of the text in the header. What it means is that you can
easily create links to various parts of your markdown files, for example:

> [this is a link to "What is Markdown"](#what-is-markdown)  
> [why and where to use it](#why--where-to-use-it)

Created like so:

```
> [this is a link to "What is Markdown"](#what-is-markdown)  
> [why and where to use it](#why--where-to-use-it)
```

The text is of the header is made lowercase, spaces are changed to `-`, thus
creating the id.

You can mix and match different markdown elements, for example you can turn
images into links.

Some interfaces support checkboxes:

```
- [ ] task#1
- [x] task#2
```

Renders as:

- [ ] task#1
- [x] task#2

### Advanced cases & libraries
---

You can create tables. For example:

```
| Name | Current State | Next State |
| :------- | :-------: | -------: | < these are dividers. 
| Green | Green | Yellow |
| Red | Red | Yellow |
```

This will render like so:

| Name | Current State | Next State |
| :------- | :-------: | -------: | 
| Green | Green | Yellow |
| Red | Red | Yellow |  

You can prepend or append these dividers with a colon. A colon before means 
that the text will allign to the left, a color after means that the text will
align to the right, on both ends means that it will be centered.

You can collapse and hide text using a collapsable element. This is another
case where you have to use HTML.

```
<details>
    <summary>Collapse me!&ltsummary>
    Here is some info:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Et malesuada fames ac
    turpis egestas maecenas.
</details>
```

Renders as:

<details>
    <summary>Collapse me!</summary>
    Here is some info:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Et malesuada fames ac
    turpis egestas maecenas.
</details>
<br>
One other interesting thing that is interesting is foot notes:

```
Happy trees are happy [^1] (press 1)

[^1]: They are indeed
```
Will render as: 

Happy trees are happy [^1] (press 1)

[^1]: They are indeed

This should link the `^1`. This is not a default Markdown feature, it may not be
present on your platform. This is extended syntax. It works in note-taking
apps, such as Obsidian.

### Cheery on top things
---

- Markdown has emoji support ðŸ˜Ž
- Supports typesetting with LaTeX (for formulas and stuff)
- There are many plugins in the Markdown ecosystem (e.g. Mermaid lets you
create diagrams with text and code)


### Conclusions
---

There are many markup languages, Python uses RST, many Python projects use RST
files. Some documentation can be auto-generated into those files. There is also
MediaWiki, a markup language for Wikipedia. If you learn Markdown, the concepts
will be similiar to many other types of markup. People write entire books just
by using Markdown. There are tools created for people who write books in
Markdown. MD is quite easy to pick up and is used in a large variety of places,
you should learn it!
