# Markdown in one minute

You can create a main title with the hash `#` symbol:
# Title

You can create secondary titles with multiple hash symbols, `##` for h2, `###`
for h3 and so on:

## title2
### title3
#### title4
##### title5
###### title6

You can describe different sections with different numbers of hash signs.
They are h1-h6 from HTML.

Make a paragraph by just typing. If you want to have your sentence on the next
line use two spaces after the line ` ` ` `  
like so :)

You can make a codeblock by surrounding something with three back ticks ```` ``` ```` : 

```
this is code 
```

You can do it `inline` with the a single back tick `` ` ``.  

You can create a link by surrounding [it] in square brackets and inserting a
link in parantheses (https://duckduckgo.com/) like [so](https://duckduckgo.com/).

Images follow the same structure but you have to prefix
that with an exclamation mark `![alt text](image path)`:

![Markdown](img/markdown.png)

For line break use \<br\>.  
To make something italic surround text with *, to make
something bold use **, bold and italic use *** like so:  

- *italic*  
- **bold**  
- ***bold and italic***  

Create a list with: 
```
1. 
2. 
3.
```
or
```
1. 
1. 
1.
```
like so:

1. this is `1.`
1. this is `2.` 
1. this is `3.` 
1. this is `1.`
1. this is `1.`
1. this is `1.`

To make a quote use `>`:

>this is a quote
